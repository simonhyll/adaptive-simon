This is an opinionated way of handling your Git usage to enable powerful tooling for doing as much automated project management as possible. It is **not** made to fit into your existing workflow or adapt to it, if you don't handle Git the way I want you to then this will not work well for you. You have been warned.

## Version

Determining the necessary version bump is as simple as going down this list, once you say yes you stop and that's the version you need to bump:

- Major:
  - Did you change/delete the function signature of any public functions?
- Minor:
  - Did you add new public functions?
- Patch:
  - Did all public function signatures remain the same?

## Changelog

The changelogs get generated based on git commit messages.

## Deploy

Deploying projects happens by triggering workflows on a schedule. Deployments are handled using different channels.

- `nightly`: Gets released at 00:00 every day. The version number is determined to be the highest currently available suffixed with `-nightly`.
