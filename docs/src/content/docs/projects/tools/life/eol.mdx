title: End of Life
summary: |
  This is inspired by [efterlevandeguiden.se](https://efterlevandeguiden.se/) which has helped me recently. The idea behind this tool is effectively to first re-implement what they have, then expand on it, give it more details, and as much as possible offer automations to take care of certain steps, such as crafting emails and email lists for all the various services the deceased might have been using to cancel subscriptions and such.

:::caution
While this tool may be useful to non-swedes as well, it's based on the Swedish procedures after death and may not at all apply to your country. There's also no guarantee it's as accurate and up to date as [efterlevandeguiden.se](https://efterlevandeguiden.se/), so please use this as a supplement, not as a replacement.

:::danger
While it may be tempting to digitalise all documents and procedures, the information you're gathering on your loved one is highly confidential to the very highest of degrees, and is subject to all kinds of rules and regulations. For instance, you can't just toss their personal data up in a Google Drive folder since that could cause their data to escape the EU, meaning you're in violation of GDPR. Or what if your account gets hacked, now there's someone out there that know as much about your loved one as you do.

In short, when this tool offers printing options, it's because you're supposed to handle most of your process with pen and paper. This tool runs entirely within in your browser, it's hosted on GitHub Pages, there's no API backend for it, it's all 100% running inside your own local machine, but even then I want to limit the tool to as non-critical information as possible that might be put into the site to offer some functionalities. Don't trust anyone with
