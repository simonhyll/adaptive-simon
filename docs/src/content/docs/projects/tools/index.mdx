description: This is a collection of small online tools I decided to develop

  One part of the motivation behind this is to not need to jump on a bunch of shady sites with weird ads and cookie warnings, the other is that sometimes I think of useful tools for myself that I develop locally for myself, but I could've just as well developed it for others to use.

  So here it is, my list of tools.

While most tools are made to be as web capable as possible, some of them will require a connector to be installed on your computer to run certain commands.

That connector is still just an idea in my head, I haven't had time to develop it yet, but it'll be for things like running certain maintenance tasks or installing sets of applications.
