description: My own recipe for beef jerky!
summary: |
  **Time:** 12 hours<br/>
  **Difficulty**: 3/10<br/>

  This recipe mostly takes a long time for the drying process, but if you just get the amounts and ingredients right it's basically just a matter of throwing it all in a bowl, tossing it in the oven, then tumbling down the stairs after gaining all of the weight.

## Ingredients

<div class="contains-task-list">

- [ ] Beef, 500 gram
- [ ] Smoked paprika spice, 1 tablespoon
- [ ] Honey, 2 tablespoons
- [ ] Smokey flavor concentrate, 4 drops
- [ ] Salt, 1 tablespoon
- [ ] Water, 2dl
</div>

## Checklist

<Steps>

1. ###### Throw all the ingredients in a bowl
   Yes, all of them, including the beef. If your beef is thin enough from the store you don't need to cut it thinner, it'll fall apart real easy anyway.

2. ###### Leave the beef to marinate

   For at least 2 hours but preferably overnight.

3. ###### Put the beef on a grate

   If you have one in your oven you may be surprised to learn that those can often just be cleaned off and put on an oven pan to create a drying rack.

4. ###### Put the oven on 80 for about 30 minutes

   This should raise the meats temperature high enough to make it safe to consume.

5. ###### Put the oven on a drying setting

   ... if it has one, otherwise go as low as possible, anywhere between 50 and 75 will do just fine.

6. ###### Leave in the oven for about 12 hours

   The meat shouldn't be the least bit moist anymore, if it is you should leave it for another couple of hours and maybe raise the temperature a little bit.
